Open both the test window and code window (horizontal mode)
Switch back and forth between the two

Run the test suite from within vim `! ruby %`
Note broken tests
"Oh my gosh, who wrote this code!?"
:!git blame %
"Oh"

Note the typo of "response" and "reponse"
Search and replace (%s/reponse/response/g)

Note next test failure (bad argument)
Jump to the error line with :line_number
pry alias

Open a new file called "API JSON response"
Call the API from within vim, using curl
Examine the response, note the missing "image_url" key
Call the API using another artist name
and fix the error on line 10 using "change in quotes"
Go on a "change in" tangent, demo on longer strings
